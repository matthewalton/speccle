# The Speccle convention

The written contract every skill and every Speccle tool implements. Terminology is
defined in [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md); decisions behind this shape are in
[`docs/adr`](adr).

## The feature folder

A feature is a directory **named for the feature**, owning one vertical slice. The name
announces the slice — `scanner/`, never an unnamed catch-all like `src/` or `lib/` —
and holds even when a project has only one feature: the slice is self-announcing, and a
second feature has an obvious home beside it.

Every feature folder has the same shape:

```
scanner/
├── SPEC.md          ← the acceptance criteria
├── CONTEXT.md       ← the feature's language (a glossary, nothing else)
├── AGENTS.md        ← how an agent works the slice
├── decisions/       ← the feature's ADRs, one file per decision
│   └── 0001-<slug>.md
└── src/
    ├── scanner.ts
    └── scanner.test.ts
```

The root holds the markdown contract and nothing else. All code and tests sit in
`src/`, tests beside the code they defend. The subfolder is always named `src` —
uniformity is the point: every feature folder in every project has an identical shape,
so nothing about a particular slice needs explaining. `decisions/` appears with the
feature's first decision; the other four entries are the floor, even for a tiny
feature.

Everything about the feature lives inside the subtree. An agent landing in the folder
needs nothing else to understand it — and `AGENTS.md` is where it starts reading.

## SPEC.md

```markdown
---
key: CHECKOUT
---

# Checkout

Optional intro prose about the feature.

## [CHECKOUT-1] Tax rounds half-up per line item

Tax is computed per line item and rounded half-up to 2dp before summing.

Edge cases:

- three line items of £1.99 at 20% → £1.20 tax; taxing the £5.97 basket total would give
  £1.19

## [CHECKOUT-2] Empty basket totals zero
```

Rules:

1. **Frontmatter declares the feature key**: `key: <KEY>` where `<KEY>` matches
   `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,9}`. Keys are unique across the repo.
2. **Each criterion is an H2**: `## [KEY-n] <statement>`. The statement is one testable
   clause — single behaviour, no weasel words, measurable.
3. **Statements speak product, defaulting to a When/Then shape**
   ([ADR-0032](adr/0032-criterion-statements-are-product-voiced-when-then.md)):
   "When X, Y" — the trigger, then the outcome, readable without seeing code. A simple
   invariant may stay plain declarative (`An empty basket totals zero`). Code-level
   precision that is contractual — exact messages, ordering, regexes — lives in the
   body, never the statement.
4. **The body is free.** Rationale, edge cases, examples — anything about that one
   behaviour. A body may be empty.
5. **Ids are names, not order.** Document position carries order. A new criterion takes
   the next never-used number under its key. An id is never renumbered or reused —
   deleting `[CHECKOUT-2]` retires the number forever.
6. **H2s in a spec are criteria.** Non-criterion structure belongs in intro prose,
   criterion bodies, or `CONTEXT.md`.

## CONTEXT.md (per feature)

The feature's glossary, in the style of this repo's own root `CONTEXT.md`: the domain
language — each term defined once, with an _Avoid_ line naming the synonyms not to use.

A glossary only. Decisions never live here — they are ADRs in `decisions/`
([ADR-0021](adr/0021-feature-decisions-are-adrs-context-md-is-glossary-only.md)). The
boundary: about a word → `CONTEXT.md`; about one behaviour → that criterion's body in
`SPEC.md`; a choice spanning criteria → `decisions/`.

## AGENTS.md (per feature)

The slice's agent-facing entry point, following the cross-tool convention of the same
name. It orients in one screenful, stating only what the folder cannot show:

- what the slice does — a sentence or two
- how to run its tests (and any other commands the slice needs)
- where the contract lives: `SPEC.md` for the criteria, `CONTEXT.md` for the language,
  `decisions/` for the choices — and that tests claim criteria by `[KEY-n]` token

Facts about _working_ the slice belong here; facts about the feature's _behaviour_
belong in `SPEC.md`. Duplicating either in the other is drift waiting to happen.

## decisions/ (per feature)

The feature's architecture decision records: choices that span criteria, one numbered
file per decision — `decisions/0001-<slug>.md`, in the same form as any ADR (status,
context, decision, consequences). The folder appears with the first decision. A choice
about one behaviour is not a decision record — it is that criterion's body.

## Test linking

A test defends a criterion when the `[KEY-n]` token appears anywhere in its **full
concatenated name** — enclosing `describe` titles included. One
`describe('[CHECKOUT-1] tax rounding', …)` claims every test inside it. Mutation and
coverage reports already carry full names, so the join is mechanical.

## Spec discovery

Tools find every `SPEC.md` under the target root. Directories named `node_modules`,
`dist`, `fixtures`, or `__fixtures__` — and dot-directories — are never entered. The
skip list is fixed, not configuration
([ADR-0016](adr/0016-spec-discovery-skips-fixture-directories.md)): a project that
fixtures deliberately dirty specs for its own tests still lints clean at its root,
and a feature directory may not take one of the skipped names.

## Lint

`oracle lint` enforces this contract deterministically. Fixed rules, one severity, no
configuration. The rule set:

| Rule                 | Judges                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `missing-key`        | Frontmatter `key` absent or malformed                          |
| `key-collision`      | Two specs declare the same key                                 |
| `key-mismatch`       | A criterion id's key differs from the spec's declared key      |
| `malformed-id`       | H2 without a well-formed `[KEY-n]` token                       |
| `duplicate-id`       | The same id appears twice                                      |
| `empty-statement`    | Criterion heading has a token but no statement                 |
| `weasel-wording`     | Statement hedges (`should`, `appropriately`, `as expected`, …) |
| `compound-criterion` | Statement contains more than one testable clause               |
| `unmeasurable`       | Statement asserts nothing observable                           |
| `code-voice`         | Statement reads as code rather than product language           |

Quality rules (`weasel-wording`, `compound-criterion`, `unmeasurable`, `code-voice`)
judge the heading statement only — the body is never linted.

`compound-criterion` exempts one bare `and`/`or` — a compound noun phrase names one
thing (`restores stock and credit`). A second bare conjunction in the main clause flags:
it reads as a list of behaviours (`restores stock and credits the customer and emails
them`). Conjunctions inside a condition (`when the card is expired and the retry limit
is reached`) qualify one outcome and are not counted.

`unmeasurable` never allow-lists the verbs a statement may use. It flags a closed list of
predicates that name activity without an outcome (`is handled`, `works`, `supports`, …)
and main clauses that name a property (`The dashboard is beautiful`). Any other verb
passes, including a domain verb the rule has never seen (`a refund credits the
customer`). It under-flags by design
([ADR-0010](adr/0010-unmeasurable-flags-vacuous-shapes-not-unlisted-verbs.md)).

`code-voice` judges the raw statement — here a code span is the strongest signal, not a
stripped literal. Signals, first match wins: a code span; a file path, recognised by a
closed extension list (`cjs`, `css`, `html`, `js`, `json`, `jsx`, `md`, `mjs`, `sh`,
`toml`, `ts`, `tsx`, `txt`, `yaml`, `yml`); an identifier — camelCase with at least two
leading lowercase letters (brand names like iPhone pass), snake_case, or call
parentheses. Plain acronyms (JSON, HTTP) and unlisted extensions pass — the rule
under-flags by design
([ADR-0032](adr/0032-criterion-statements-are-product-voiced-when-then.md)).

## v1 target stack

The convention is language-agnostic, but v1 tooling targets: TypeScript, vitest,
StrykerJS with `perTest` coverage analysis, Istanbul `json-summary` coverage.
